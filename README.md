# FirebaseChat
Hey Guys, this is my first Android App. The reason that I named this app as FirebaseChat was simply because I am using Firebase as my database for this App. Firebase is a very good cloud database for designing mobile apps, here is a link if you guys wants to have a look:www.firebase.google.com

# Features
- Register accounts
- See all members
- Upload profile image
- Request as friend/Delete requests
- Send messages to each other

# Bug
- There is a bug which you can send friend request to yourself, I have't fix it, but it should be simple, just get a data snapshot and see if the current user id is equal to the user you are vewing, then disable the request friend button.

By the way, I got a lot of help from these videos on youtube, you should have a look first if you don't have any ideas of what you are doing. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl6DxakCjDR5AfRwWhWNbMg
